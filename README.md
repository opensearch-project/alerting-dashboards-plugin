# OpenSearch Alerting Dashboards

The OpenSearch Alerting Dashboards plugin lets you manage your [OpenSearch Alerting plugin](https://github.com/opensearch-project/alerting) to monitor your data and send notifications when certain criteria are met---all from OpenSearch Dashboards.

## Highlights

- Create and schedule *monitors*, which run period queries against data in Opensearch.
- Evaluate query results against *triggers* to see if they meet certain criteria.
- If trigger criteria are met, generate *alerts* and perform *actions* (e.g. post a message in a Slack channel).
