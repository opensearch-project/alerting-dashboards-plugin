        Specify message frequency to limit the number of notifications you receive within a given
        span of time. This setting is especially useful for low severity trigger conditions.
      </p>
      <p>Consider the following example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A trigger condition is met.</li>
        <li>The monitor sends a message</li>
        <li>Message frequency is set to 10 minutes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For the next 10 minutes, even if a trigger condition is met dozens of times, the monitor
        sends no additional messages. If the trigger condition is met 11 minutes later, the monitor
        sends another message.
      </p>
    </EuiText>
