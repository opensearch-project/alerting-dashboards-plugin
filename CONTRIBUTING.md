## Contributing to OpenSearch

OpenSearch is a community project that is built and maintained by people just like **you**.
[This document](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) explains how you can contribute to this and related projects.

## Developer Certificate of Origin

OpenSearch is an open source product released under the Apache 2.0 license (see either [the Apache](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) site or the [LICENSE.txt file](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/blob/main/LICENSE.txt)). The Apache 2.0 license allows you to freely use, modify, distribute, and sell your own products that include Apache 2.0 licensed software.

We respect intellectual property rights of others and we want to make sure all incoming contributions are correctly attributed and licensed. A Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight mechanism to do that.

The DCO is a declaration attached to every contribution made by every developer. In the commit message of the contribution, the developer simply adds a `Signed-off-by` statement and thereby agrees to the DCO, which you can find below or at [DeveloperCertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/).

have the right to submit it under the open source license

best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open
source license and I have the right under that license to

or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless
I am permitted to submit under a different license), as
Indicated in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution

consistent with this project or the open source license(s)

You may type this line on your own when writing your commit messages. However, if your user.name and user.email are set in your git configs, you can use `-s` or `â€“-signoff` to add the `Signed-off-by` line to the end of the commit message.
